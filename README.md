This project focuses on developing acoustic models to convert speech audio recordings into text using hidden Markov models (HMM). The main tools utilized in the project are HTK (Hidden Markov Model Toolkit) for training acoustic models and Julius for evaluating their real-time performance.

The database that the model is trained on can be found on this site: https://www.croris.hr/crosbi/publikacija/prilog-skup/496523
